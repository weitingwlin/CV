## Research interests:  
I study the spatial and temporal scale-dependency of species interactions in an insect food web associated with a high marsh plant. Using field observations, experiments, computer simulations and analysis of existing datasets, I aim to investigate how small-scale experimental results could help us understand species interaction at the landscape scale.
